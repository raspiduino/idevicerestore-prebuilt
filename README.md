(Running directly on WSL without any installation)

You don't need to build or install anything. It's already in this repo.
Just run `./idevicerestore` and enjoy :)

The code is build directly from original source with <b>ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGES</b>, so the binaries will be the same license as their original source code.

For source code, see the original projects. I will update the link to them later.
